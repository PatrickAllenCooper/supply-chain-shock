# supply-chain-shock
Intended as a simulated world in Unity where the principles which govern real-time strategy scenarios are combined with real economic principles to simulate economic shock under different scenarios.

## Premise
Resiliency and efficiency are often presented as opposed in economic theory, and indeed, they must be by necessity. However, what do we know about possible local optimizations that may allow us to have our cake and eat it too.

## Methodoloy
Initial MLAgents Unity Project is currently under construction...

## Disclaimer
This is not intended to be a substitute for existing economic modeling. Certainly, the complexity and resolution of the constructions here are primitive at best. Regardless, there is an unique variety of insight which is provided in such characterizations, that is, counterintuitive optimizations which can be yielded only when insight about the distributions involved in the uncertainty of unpredictable events is fashioned.

Naturally, predicting black swan events is impossible, but characterizing their genus and species need not be. For this reason, we can look into a particular class of vulnerability and utilize Monte Carlo to guess about what may occur and harness such random perturbations to discover what dynamics might encourage resiliency.
